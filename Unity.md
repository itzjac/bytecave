# Rants
* Editor log, when it crashes the location of the file is under the APPlData folder in windows. Is very clumsy to re open everytime a fatal crash or hang happens
* Debugging, the output window in the VStudio is different than the console in Unity
* The engine is built around the concept of assets, the game is in the code
* Code is also an asset type
* No access to source code
* Class name clashes are easy to produce, and the error is detected very late at runtime
* No native console commands in game window supported
* Simples way to output to visual studio Log
* TMPro support and legacy
*Provide profile file sharing
