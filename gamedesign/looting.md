# Looting

Looting is a great example to refer to when people think designing and making games is easy.

This is a problem that alings with many of the challenges found on the famous "Door Problem" written by Liz England 
[ The Door Problem ](https://lizengland.com/blog/2014/04/the-door-problem/).

Looting can be approached depending its source or how is generated: killing NPCs, in-game micro transactions, boss fights, achievements, accolades.

In this document, we are going to focus for the case of Looting through treasure chests (a.k.a. loot boxes).

## Treasure chests

### The logic

Translating the Door Problem into the domain of looting chests
 * Are there chests in the game?
 * Can the player open the chests?
 * Can the player open every chest in the game?
 * Are there decoration chests?
 * How to differenciate decorative and loot chests?
 * Can multiple players interact with the chests?
 * Is the loot to all players or only the one who opened it?
 * Can the chests contain unusable items?
 * Can the chests contain traps?
 * Can the chests attack and kill a player?
 * Can the cheets loot game's currency?
 * Are there secret chests?
 
RPGs tend to also heavily lean on player's progress to increment or modify the looting system.
 

### The visuals

 * A minimum accessible area where to spawn loot and guarantee 

 * VFXs, chests and all the loot must contain animation and VFx for visual feedback when opened
 
 * Network validated, depending what design desicion was taken, multiple players should access to every item in the loot and "fight" for its ownership
 

### The genre

Most commonly abused in with Dungeon Crawlers type of game, it is possible to find  

 * First/Third/OTS person
 
 * Dungeon crawlers and the isometric camera
